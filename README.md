A simple web application that displays AI-themed movies categorized by generation.

## Setup

    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd ai-movie-directory
    ```
3.  **Update `movies.js`:**  Open `movies.js` and replace `"YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY"` with the API key you obtained.
4.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

## Usage
